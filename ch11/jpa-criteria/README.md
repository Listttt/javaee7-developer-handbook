README
-------


In order to build and test this project, you really need an instance of GlassFish 4.0.1 application server running already.
This is because the Arquillian tests rely on a *Remote* GlassFish instance. 
You also need to connect a MySQL database to GlassFish.

For further information and full instructions on running the examples, please EXAMINE THE PARENT FOLDER of the project for README file.
